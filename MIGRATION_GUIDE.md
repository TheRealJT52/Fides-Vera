# Migration Guide: Replit to GitHub

This guide will help you migrate all files from this Replit project to a GitHub repository.

## Initial Migration Steps

### 1. Download All Files from Replit

There are two ways to download all files from Replit:

#### Option A: Use Replit's Export Feature
1. Click on the three dots (...) in the file explorer
2. Select "Download as zip"
3. This will download a zip file with all project files

#### Option B: Use Git Command Line
1. Initialize a Git repository in your Replit project (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. Add all files to Git:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. Create an initial commit:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit for migration"
   ```

4. Connect to your GitHub repository:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

5. Push all files to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### 2. Create a New GitHub Repository

1. Go to GitHub and create a new repository
2. Do not initialize it with any files
3. Follow the instructions on GitHub to push an existing repository

## Post-Migration Tasks

After migrating all files to GitHub:

1. Ensure the `.env.example` file is included
2. Test the application by following the README.md instructions
3. If node_modules or other large directories cause problems, you can add them to .gitignore after the initial migration

## Important Files to Verify

Ensure these key files have been migrated properly:

- All source code in client/ and server/ directories
- Configuration files (.env.example, package.json, etc.)
- Documentation files (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE)
- GitHub workflow files (.github/ directory)

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the migration:

1. Verify that all environment variables are documented in .env.example
2. Check the GitHub Actions workflow for any missing paths or directories
3. If the application requires API keys, ensure they're properly documented

## Final Checklist

- [ ] All source code files are present in the GitHub repository
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] GitHub templates for issues and PRs are in place
